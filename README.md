# This is my nvim config.

Need to have previously installed: <br />
[Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) <br />
[Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) <br />

When cloned the repository via https or ssh just run ":PackerSync" and everything should work just fine.
